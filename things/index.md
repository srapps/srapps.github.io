# Things I Like

- The [amazon.com reviews of Joel M. Kauffman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SYMCC1A6GQ4X/103-2079496-3473438?_encoding=UTF8&display=public&page=1). Dr. Kauffman has a great eye for error.
- [This song](http://www.lyex.cn/wenjian/2005711144047.mp3) (or [here](http://salad.cai.swufe.edu.cn/1.mp3)) (In Mongolian. A child asks her parents: “Sun, moon, stars - what are they?” Parents: “Three lucky things.” Child: “Greenery, flower, fruit - what are they?” Parents: “Three lucky things.” Child: “Father, mother, me - what are they?” Parents: “Three lucky things.” If you can give a better translation, please [contact me](/contact/).) Frequently played on Chinese TV.
- 2005 O’Brian, T. L. [*TrumpNation: The art of being The Donald.*](http://www.fetchbook.info/compare.do?search=0446578541) New York: Warner Business Books. "I haven't read it but someone who did told me it is an inaccurate pile of crap," said Trump about this book, according to the *New York Post*. AIDS researcher Robert Gallo was another fan of the I-haven't-read-it trope.
- [Quasi-reinforcement](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1338316&blobtype=pdf) is a way of making reward more powerful. It was discovered by Allen Neuringer and Shin-Ho Chung in pigeon experiments in the 1960s. Suppose a pigeon is given food every 500 times it pecks a key. It will peck a key for such "lean" reward, but slowly. Now suppose the experimenter briefly turns on a light every 20 pecks. The pigeon will roughly double its rate of pecking. The salary hasn't changed &#8212; the light alone has no value to the pigeon, it will not peck to turn on the light &#8212; but output has doubled. What an incredible effect! It has not been studied much but has been found with rats.
- The journalism of [Bruce Bawer](http://www.brucebawer.com/). [While Europe Slept](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385514727/sr=8-1/qid=1141329192/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-2079496-3473438?%5Fencoding=UTF8) is fascinating.
- 2006 Easterly, W. [*The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good*](http://www.fetchbook.info/compare.do?search=1594200378). New York: Penguin Press. Foreign aid efforts have failed again and again and again &#8212; the seeming inability of those in charge of those efforts to learn from failure is remarkable. I doubt this is restricted to foreign aid.
