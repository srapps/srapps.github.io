# Success Stories

As I prepared to write *The Shangri-La Diet*, I gathered success stories from my friends. After the *Freakonomics* column about the diet, however, my collection of stories was swamped by a much larger number of success stories posted on the Web. This page provides a sampling. In the [forums](http://boards.sethroberts.net/) over 100 people are posting their [progress](http://boards.sethroberts.net/index.php?PHPSESSID=cbbc4a82d3aa646123ee19ecdb2c7c60&board=5.0).

After Ann Hendricks started her [blog](http://shangrilawatcher.blogspot.com/), about a dozen people regularly reported their progress. Almost all were successful - so much so that Ann asked people to post failures. She didn't get many.

## CalorieLab

After CalorieLab posted a long [article](http://calorielab.com/news/2005/09/21/seth-roberts-shangri-la-diet-in-detail/) about the diet, comments poured in, many contradicting the article's skeptical tone with their own experience of success.

## Lily M.

I started the Shangri-La diet the same day I read the Freakonomics column about it in the New York Times Magazine.

## Sarah

Sarah's problem with her weight began when she was young. "When I was nine, I weighed 109," she said. Growing up, she always weighed more than she wanted to. In her forties, she tried Weight Watchers, which worked for a while. . . . [continues](http://media.sethroberts.net/stories/2006-04-30_Sarah.pdf)* -- Sarah, Bay Area, California*

## Sean

I started at 184 lbs (I'm 6 foot 1 inch) and, using Seth Roberts's "Shangri-La" approach, lost 11% of my body weight (20.5 lbs or about 1.4 lbs per week) over 15 weeks... [continues](http://media.sethroberts.net/stories/2006-04-30_Sean.pdf) *-- Sean, Highland Ranch, Colorado*

In 1992 my world fell apart. My eldest child became sick. In the next five years I would bury three children and gain almost sixty pounds. By the time the world was stable under my feet again, I was about 240 pounds and unable to lose weight...
