> I am seeing some results -- I am feeling fuller with smaller portions and my sweet tooth seems to have lost its fangs. Example: It is normal for me to eat one of those 2-portion bags of M&M's in one sitting, but on Friday at the movies, I only ate half. And, weirder still, I still have possession of the bag and *there are still M&M's in there*.

> The loss of appetite is wonderful so I quit when I am full -- so yes I have changed my eating habits. This morning I woke up no appetite. I used to be a big breakfast eater so scrambled a couple of eggs could only eat one so shared them with my dog. 'The dog is loving my loss of appetite too.' I also am drinking a lot more water. I used to choke it down; now it is my drink of choice. I think for me snacking was my demon -- after lunch within 15 minutes I would be hungry again and would eat from that time on until after dinner and I am not tempted anymore.

Then through some posts and some help I upped my intake of oil from 2 tbl spoons a day to 4 and that is what did it for me. Since June 22 I now feel like all those posts that you read about and hope to achieve. AMAZING when you find your set point. ... Since then I don't feel hungry in the morning, for lunch have a couple of pieces of fresh fruit, for dinner I steam some vegtables and a piece of good wheat bread and that's it for the day. It's just unbelievable. Not hardly eating anything and don't feel like it either. NO CRAVINGS either. And, I'm a psycholocal and emotional eater too. It just seems to take care of everything. WOW!! ... This is life changing stuff!

Also, I've come to realize that living too long can be a whole lot worse than dying in good time. So what I'm saying is I'm not very motivated to lose weight, and haven't been for a whole long time. ... Still, when I read about the Shangri-La diet, I just had to try it out. The claims were just too outrageous, and I just could not see any downside. It was a 'just gotta check this out' kind of thing. After three weeks, I didn't know how much weight I'd lost because I never weigh myself. But I'd taken my belt in a notch(and now I'm down a second notch). ... I'll be on this regimen forever, I think, because of one reason. I have lost the constant urge to eat, and that is real freedom. I realize that sooner or later I'll hit the new dynamically balanced set point and this blissful state will fade somewhat. But until then I'm really enjoying it. I'll never be able to report how much weight I've lost, but as far as I'm concerned, I've lost something that was far more terrible than weight - that enthrallment to food.

> It's amazing not to feel my hunger increasing as I lose weight. The whole experience of weight losing is different. Usually it is like holding your breath underwater&#x2014;the longer you go without air, the more massively you need air. Usually the longer you are on a diet the more hungry you are. This is so strikingly different. Formerly, if I was trying to get down, I would be, say, terribly hungry at about 170 pounds and never able to get below it. It felt like trying to hold your breath for four minutes&#x2014;the body just won't let you. Now I suspect that this barrier at 170 pounds probably won't be there when I get to 170.

My blood pressure was usually about 140/85 - 90 and my resting pulse was about 100 - which quite worried me and no-one had an explanation for. Since starting the SLD my blood pressure has dropped to 120/80 and my resting pulse is down to 78. How amazing is that!! Given that my dad died last year of a brain heommorage and my mum has had a stroke I am justified in having been worried about this. Not to mention being overweight myself with chronic inflammation and a permanently raised CRP (a marker for heart disease). This benefit of the diet may be the best yet. And I'm pretty sure that it's not weight loss because my blood pressure only went down in the past (on Atkins) when I weighed about 30 lbs less than I do now. Plus, I've tracked my blood pressure and pulse down over the last few weeks and it's been descending slowly, as if in response to the oil. It's very strange, but fan-bloody-tastic if you ask m

I didn't start SL to lose weight, rather to see if I could maintain my weight while eating like a 'normal' person, and it has worked beautifully for me. While I do still think about food (that's par for the course when you've got an ED), I get ridiculously full so quickly that it's difficult to take in more than a normal portion size at any given sitting (no more bingeing!). I've also become more rigorous about eating non-processed, whole, low-glycemic foods, and the combination of those changes and the oil has been very powerful. The upshot is, I'm eating the healthiest diet in the world, and not gaining weight. It's truly amazing: this has achieved in a few weeks what years of shrinks and medication could not&#x2014;go figure!
